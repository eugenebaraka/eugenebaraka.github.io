# eugenebaraka.gihub.io
This is the source code for my static jekyll-powered [blog](https://eugenebaraka.github.io). A substantial amount of code used in development of this site is from the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and [personal](https://le4ker.github.io/personal-jekyll-theme/) jekyll themes. 

## Installation
Make sure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) as well as [bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system. See websites for instructions depending on your OS, then run the following in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eugenebaraka/eugenebaraka.github.io.git
cd eugenebaraka.github.io

bundle exec jekyll serve
```
