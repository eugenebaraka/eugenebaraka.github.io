Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> have enjoyed reading this book about creating new habits, breaking bad ones, and becoming better version of myself each day. The author starts the book by arguing that we fail to achieve our goals not because they are too hard or we are not committed enough, but because we have established the wrong systems. 

Designing your way to your goal instead of merely focusing on the goal itself will make your habit last and will not restrict your happiness/freedom; that's what will eventually distinguish you from losers. Success is overpraised in our society that we often focus on the finish line and want to succeed overnight. He continues by emphasizing that massive success is rarely achieved by massive changes, rather by small habits that compound over time. If a person could focus on getting 1% better on a habit each day, the improvement they will have made after a year amounts up to 37.78 times better (INCROYABLE!!). What about after two years or ten? (I will leave that up to you to calculate)

The book helped me rethink and restrategize my habits including reading, exercising, and continuous learning. As a lifelong learner, I often get stuck in my learning process and very often feel like giving up. However, I was reminded that the habit will not always feel enjoyable or comfortable. I will need to put in those hours even when it feels like the most boring thing I've ever done.

>"Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It's the ability to keep going when work isn't exciting that makes the difference"

My last takeaway is mastering the art of showing up. Even when your habit is already established and is enjoyable and satisfying, bad days will happen. However, we shouldn't fall into an "all-or-nothing" trap. Do not think that if you can't do something perfectly you shouldn't do it at all. Show up, even on your bad days, and see your habit and progress compound over time.

I 100% recommend this book to anyone looking for ways to create good habits that will last and break bad habits. The strategies and steps presented are research-backed and practical.
