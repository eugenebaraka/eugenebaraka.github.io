My name is Eugene and I am currently a master's student in Public Health at McGill University. 
        I like to see the result of my work right away....
        I like numbers and statistics, therefore registering in my masters program, the combination of
        these both ....my enrollment in the public health program. In my first year of the program, 
        I remember writing my first line code in R in the fall of 2021. I love numbers
        and statistics.  Oh wow..I felt 
        like I have the world, haha. Ever since I have been looking for ways to learn new tools. Learn more about me!

        I am interested in the intersection of health and data science, so on this blog, I will 
        be writing about my interests, and what I am up to. In this blog, I will be writing about data science, 
        personal projects, and interesting books I am reading.
